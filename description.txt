The parameters that are used for experimenting the RNN + attention model are given below

1. min_word_count : The minimum threshold of word count, the word with count above it will be accepted.
2. word_Embedding_dimension : The word embedding dimension used for embedding the semantic information.
3. hidden_layer_sizes : The list vaiable contain the size of hidden layers, while number of element denotes number of hidden layer.
4. learning_rate : the learning rate of model.
5. epoch : Number of time the whole train set is iterated for training model.
6. RecurrentUnit : The recurrent unit is used in Recurrent layer:
                    SimpleRecurrentLayer: Vannila Recurrent unit
                    GRU : Gated Recurrent Unit
                    LSTM : Long Short Term Memory
7. stopwrds : There are the words that have high frequency in text with very little semantic value in text.
